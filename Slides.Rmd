## Project intro

## Getting started with Linux (OS-GEO)

We will do this together during the lesson:

* Open that file (vmx) within VMWare Viewer
* See screenshots

## Getting started with Linux (OS-GEO)

* Who know's what a `Virtual Machine` is?

* What is the difference with `Dual Boot`?

## Getting started with Linux (OS-GEO)

[OS-Geo Live](http://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html) is Virtual Machine based on Lubuntu, that allows you to try a wide variety of open source geospatial software without installing anything. It is composed entirely of free software, allowing it to be freely distributed, duplicated and passed around.

- Lubuntu
    - A fast and lightweight operating system. The core of the system is based on Linux - Ubuntu
- Ubuntu
    - A Linux distribution
    - named after the Southern African philosophy of ubuntu (literally, "human-ness"), which often is translated as "humanity towards others"
    - User friendly and accessible
    
- Virtual Machine
    - In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a particular computer system (e.g. operating system)


## OSGEO Live

Why? Any clues?

## Launching R, Rstudio, Python

Let try that together.

Running Python:

* Via QGIS -> Plug-inns -> Python Console
* Choose you own preferred editor for Python scripts
    * Gedit as simple but good text editor
    * Eric
    * Spyder
