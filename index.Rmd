## The geo-challenge

* Objective
    * Demonstrate scripting skills in a spatial oriented challenge
    * Demonstrate capacity to read, visualize, and write spatial data that other can use
    * Use different functions and libraries (e.g. try out new libraries)
    * Write a clear, structured and well documented project that is understandable by others

## The geo-challenge

* Planning
    * 4 days for project work
  
* Friday final week, per team
    - 5 minute presentation 
    - 3 minutes feedback by the other team using the rubric
* Evaluation by expert jury panel

## The geo-challenge

* Deliverables:
    * A project, repository, that is reproducible
    * Produces a result (map, analysis) for your presentation
    * A presentation where you explain
        * objective
        * workflow
        * results by some clear visualization (map, output, analysis)
        * what have you learned? 

## Example geo-challenges

- First identify a data set that you can use (e.g. data available for download, etc.). 
You need to have a small (!) data set that you can `analyse`.
- A simple challenge or question is good as long as you apply and demonstrated **geo-scripting skills**
- Python, R, both, other programming/scripting languages are fine.
- Examples:
    - [We have some topics available](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/ProjectIntro/topics.html)

## The geo-challenge

* Teams?!
    - You can work on your own or teams of two

## Assignment for today

- See https://github.com/geoscripting-2020/Project-Starter
  - Fork 
  - Add teamname
  - Clone your project
- Modify the README.md file and add the text below
    - https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
    - https://markdown-it.github.io/
    (very nice markdown examples!)
    
- Write a concise project proposal of 
    - *maximum 1/2 page*
    - **bullet points are OK!**

## Assignment for today

In the README.md:

- Team name and members
- Geo-challenge title and objective
- Task 1: **Why?** short description of what you want to do
    * Define the aim or question of your project
    
- Task 2: **What?** Describe data set
    * Provide a link to the data and describe the metadata (author, date, extent, resolution, etc.)
    * Can it be accessed via a script, and how (i.e. API or download link)?
    * Estimate how large the data set will be for your project
        - e.g. do this by a little test download of one file unless you decide to work in https://earthengine.google.com/
        - **Important here is to keep the data set small!**
        
* Task 3: **How?**: Methods and potential results
    * Which R/Python packages will you use to achieve this?
    * What will be the result, output, and/or visualization?

## Submission Deadline

* Submit your proposal before: 
    - Tuesday 21/01 12u
    - Review the other team before 16u 21/01, via pull request/reviewing
    - Joint status update on Wednesday 22/01 after 14u
