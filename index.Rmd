## Today in the morning

* Think about a feasible, concise, scripting challenge (see next slides)
* Check the question and answers forum

## overall tips and tricks

- R-SIG-GEO? Who knows what this is?

## The geo-challenge

* Objective
    * Demonstrate scripting skills in a spatial oriented challenge
    * Demonstrating capacity to read, visualize, and write spatial data that other can use
    * Using basic scripting concepts for handling spatial data
    * Using different functions and libraries (e.g. try out new libraries)
    * Writing a clear, structured and well documented project that is understandable by others

## The geo-challenge

* Planning
    * 4 days for project work
  
* Deadline
    * GitLab link deadline by Thursday (14u)
    * After that one other team needs to review the project of the other team
    * Submit presentation (pdf) to Blackboard - Script Review Center - before the end of the day

* Friday final week 
    * Presentation (5 minute presentation + 5 feedback of the other team and questions from the group)
    * Evaluation by expert jury panel

## The geo-challenge

* Deliverables:
    * A project that is reproducible and produces a result (map, analysis) for your presentation
    * Submit the project via GitLab Repository
    * A presentation where you explain
        * objective
        * workflow
        * results by some nice visualisation (map, output, analysis)
        * what have you learned? 

## Example geo-challenges

* First identify a data set that you can use (e.g. data available for download, etc.). You need to have a small (!) dataset that you can `analyse`.
* A simple challenge or question is good as long as you apply and demonstrated geo-scripting skills
* Examples:
    - [We have some topics available](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/ProjectIntro/topics.html)
* Two projects of last year will be presented during the lecture today by the student assistents.

## The geo-challenge

* Teams?!
    - You can work on your own or teams of two

## Assignment for today

* Write a consice project proposal of maximum one page that contains (bullet points is OK):
    * Team name and members
    * Geo-challenge title and objective
    * Task 1: What? short description of what you want to do
        * Define the aim of your project, for example by formulating a research question.
    * Task 2: How? Describe methodology and data set
        * Provide a link to the data and describe the metadata (author, date, extent, resoltion, etc.)
        * Can it be accessed via a script, and how (i.e. API or download link)?
    * Task 3: Result and discussion
        * What will be the result, output, and/or visualisation?
        * Which R/Python packages will you use to achieve this?
        * What challenges or issues do you foresee? 
        

* Submit your project proposal to GitLab before 1630u today so the the other team can review.
* Submit as a short readable structured text file (i.e. .txt or .md format)
    * make sure that it is easily readable
