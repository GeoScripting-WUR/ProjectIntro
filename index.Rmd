## The geo-challenge

* Objective
    * Demonstrate scripting skills in a spatial scripting challenge
    * Choose or come up with an original and novel topic
    * Write code using packages you haven't used before, make complex reusable functions with efficient code to handle spatial data
    * Make code reproducible and document well, use project structure, make good use of git
    * Create an interactive presentation and visualisation (e.g. dashboard, storymap, app, etc.)
* See also the rubric on CodeGrade

## The geo-challenge

* Planning
    * 8 days for project work (Mon-Wed)
    * Last Thursday: make interactive posters and give peer feedback
    * Last Friday: interactive digital poster session

## The geo-challenge

* Deliverables:
    * A project, repository, that is reproducible
    * Produces a result (map, analysis) for your presentation
    * An interactive poster where you explain
        * objective
        * workflow
        * results by using a clear visualization (demo, map, output, analysis)
        * what have you learned?
        * what would you do if you had more time (e.g. 6 months)?
        * not necessary to show code, optionally snippets to illustrate your point

## Example geo-challenges

- See Brightspace for predefined challenge topics and data sets
- First identify a data set that you can use (e.g. data available for download, etc.). 
    - a small (!) data set that you can *analyse*.
- A simple challenge so that you can apply and demonstrate **geoscripting skills**.
- Python, R, Bash, GEE, all, other programming/scripting languages are fine.

## Teams?!

- You will work in a team of four, but for the time being submit a topic in your current team
- If you already know what other team you want to work with, in which case:
  - Write a joint proposal and submit the same proposal for both pairs
- If not:
  - Write your own proposal, indicate whether it is on one of the predefined challenge topics or a custom topic
  - You will be merged with another group that proposed a similar topic
  - You will work according to the better proposal from the two
- Starter repositories have been created according to the current teams
- Feedback, as well as go/no-go, will be given in CodeGrade

## Exercise for today

  - Edit your Project_Proposal_Starter
  - Give the number of the topic you choose, or whether you will work on your own topic
- Modify the README.md file and add the text as per next slide
    - https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
    - https://markdown-it.github.io/
    (very nice markdown examples!)
    
- Write a concise scientific proposal (one paragraph for each heading is fine, can include lists)
- Peer-review on Codegrade - two other teams

## Exercise for today

In the README.md:

- Name for the 4-member team and list of members (if you already know this) & Project title
- Task 1: Research questions (**Why?**)
    * Define the aim or question(s) of your project, phrased as questions to answer
    * Be very concrete and specific, also quantitative
    * e.g. "How well can Random Forest classify trees, grassland and crops in the Gewata region?"
    
- Task 2: Data (**What?**)
    * Provide a link to the data and describe the metadata (author, date, extent, resolution, etc.)
    * Can it be accessed via a script, and how (i.e. API or download link)?
    * Estimate how large the data set will be for your project
        - e.g. do this by a little test download of one file unless you decide to work in Google Earth Engine
        - **Important here is to keep the data set small!** e.g. below 500 MiB
        
* Task 3: Methods (**How?**)
    * Which functionality or approach will you use to achieve this? Can you already name new packages you will want to try out?
    * What will be the result, output, and/or visualization?

## Proposal submission deadlines

* Inform us about team changes ASAP
* Submit your proposal **before next Friday 16:00**
* Review the other teams **before 17:10**, via Codegrade
* If you get a NO GO, make changes ASAP 
* **By Monday end of the day - all proposals must be approved then**
* By Monday afternoon you will know which group you are working together with and will get your Project starter repository. You can already start working on acquiring the data.

## Work during the project week

* We have room B9216+B9218 in Aurora for the whole two weeks
  * WeConnect: your team can all connect to a screen, follow the instructions at [https://wur-studentsupport.screenstepslive.com/m/104769/l/1620176-how-to-get-started-with-weconnect](https://wur-studentsupport.screenstepslive.com/m/104769/l/1620176-how-to-get-started-with-weconnect)
  * If you want a more quiet working environment, you can book a group room through [https://te.wur.nl/](https://te.wur.nl/), though note that the support will be in B9216+B9218 (or online)
* File storage: you can make use of MS Teams Files tab
  - You don't need to make file download completely reproducible!
  - Small datasets are better than big datasets
  - Put the presentation files into MS Teams Files tab as well

## Final presentation day

* We will have two sessions for the interactive presentations using WeConnect screens:
  * 10 groups will present, 10 will watch, and then we swap (40 minutes per session)
  * 5 minutes per presentation, 3 minutes for discussion
* After the presentations, we will go to a plenary session for awards, picture and feedback about the course
