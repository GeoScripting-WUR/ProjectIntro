## The geo-challenge

* Objective
    * Demonstrate scripting skills in a spatial scripting challenge
    * Demonstrate capacity to read, visualize, and write spatial data in a project that others can use
    * Use different functions and libraries (e.g. try out new libraries)
    * Write a clear, structured and well documented project that is understandable by others
* See also the rubric on CodeGrade

## The geo-challenge

* Planning
    * 4 days for project work (Mon-Thu)
* On Friday of the final week, per team:
    - 10 minute presentation 
    - 5 minutes feedback by the other team using the rubric (see CodeGrade)

## The geo-challenge

* Deliverables:
    * A project, repository, that is reproducible
    * Produces a result (map, analysis) for your presentation
    * A presentation where you explain
        * objective
        * workflow
        * results by using a clear visualization (demo, map, output, analysis)
        * what have you learned?
        * what would you do if you had more time (e.g. 6 months)?
        * not necessary to show code, optionally snippets to illustrate your point

## Example geo-challenges

- See Brightspace for predefined challenge topics and data sets
- First identify a data set that you can use (e.g. data available for download, etc.). 
    - a small (!) data set that you can *analyse*.
- A simple challenge so that you can apply and demonstrate **geoscripting skills**.
- Python, R, Bash, GEE, all, other programming/scripting languages are fine.

## Teams?!

- You will work in a team of four, but for the time being submit a topic in your current team
- If you already know what other team you want to work with, in wich case:
  - Write a joint proposal and submit the same proposal for both pairs
- If not:
  - Write your own proposal, indicate whether it is on one of the predefined challenge topics
  - You will be merged with another group that proposed a similar topic
  - You will work according to the better proposal from the two
- Starter repositories have been created according to the current teams
- Feedback, as well as go/no-go, will be given in CodeGrade

## Exercise for today

  - Edit your Project_Proposal_Starter
  - Give the number of the topic you choose, or whether you will work on your own topic
- Modify the README.md file and add the text as per next slide
    - https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
    - https://markdown-it.github.io/
    (very nice markdown examples!)
    
- Write a concise project proposal of 
    - *maximum 1/2 page*
    - **bullet points are OK!**
- Peer-review on Codegrade - two other teams

## Exercise for today

In the README.md:

- Name for the 4-member team and list of members (if you already know this)
- Project title and objective
- Task 1: **Why?**
    * Define the aim or question of your project
    
- Task 2: **What?** Describe data set
    * Provide a link to the data and describe the metadata (author, date, extent, resolution, etc.)
    * Can it be accessed via a script, and how (i.e. API or download link)?
    * Estimate how large the data set will be for your project
        - e.g. do this by a little test download of one file unless you decide to work in https://code.earthengine.google.com/
        - **Important here is to keep the data set small!**
        
* Task 3: **How?**: Methods and potential results
    * Which functionality or approach will you use to achieve this?
    * What will be the result, output, and/or visualization?

## Submission Deadlines

* Inform us about team changes ASAP
* Submit your proposal **before next Friday 15:30** (ideally before the exam)
* Review the other teams **after the exam** (before **18:30**), via Codegrade
* If you get a NO GO, make changes ASAP 
* **On Monday (January 30) morning - all proposals must be approved then**
* By Monday morning you will know which group you are working together with and will get your Project starter repository. You can already start working on acquiring the data.

## Work during the project week

* We have three rooms, so you can work in a more quiet environment
* You will be assigned to a room by the start of the project week: check myWURtoday and/or Brightspace groups
* Someone will be around throughout the day - but not necessarily in your room.
We will walk around, but if you have an urgent question, you can also look into the different rooms.
* File storage: you can make use of MS Teams Files tab
  - You don't need to make file download completely reproducible!
  - Small datasets are better than big datasets
* Put the presentation files into MS Teams Files tab as well (in your room's subdirectory)

## Final presentation day

* We will have three parallel sessions for presentations, based on topic themes (tied to the room you are working in - again see myWURtoday or Brightspace)
* After the presentations, we will go to a plenary session for awards, picture and discussion about the course set up
