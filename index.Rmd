## The geo-challenge

* Objective
    * Demonstrate scripting skills in a spatial scripting challenge
    * Demonstrate capacity to read, visualize, and write spatial data in a project that others can use
    * Use different functions and libraries (e.g. try out new libraries)
    * Write a clear, structured and well documented project that is understandable by others
* See also the rubric on CodeGrade

## The geo-challenge

* Planning
    * 4 days for project work (Mon-Thu)
* On Friday of the final week, per team:
    - 10 minute presentation 
    - 5 minutes feedback by the other team using the rubric (see CodeGrade)

## The geo-challenge

* Deliverables:
    * A project, repository, that is reproducible
    * Produces a result (map, analysis) for your presentation
    * A presentation where you explain
        * objective
        * workflow
        * results by using a clear visualization (demo, map, output, analysis)
        * what have you learned?
        * what would you do if you had more time (e.g. 6 months)?
        * not necessary to show code, optionally snippets to illustrate your point

## Example geo-challenges

- See Brightspace for predefined challenge topics and data sets
- First identify a data set that you can use (e.g. data available for download, etc.). 
    - a small (!) data set that you can *analyse*.
- A simple challenge so that you can apply and demonstrate **geoscripting skills**.
- Python, R, Bash, GEE, all, other programming/scripting languages are fine.

## The geo-challenge

* Teams?!
    - You will work in a team of four, but for **today** submit a topic in your current team
    - Starter repositories have been created according to the current teams
    - Let us know if you already know which other team you want to work with in the project

## Exercise for today

  - Edit your Project_Proposal_Starter
  - Give the number of the topic you choose, or whether you will work on your own topic
- Modify the README.md file and add the text as per next slide
    - https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
    - https://markdown-it.github.io/
    (very nice markdown examples!)
    
- Write a concise project proposal of 
    - *maximum 1/2 page*
    - **bullet points are OK!**
- Peer-review on Codegrade - two other teams

## Exercise for today

In the README.md:

- Name for the 4-member team and list of members (if you already know this)
- Project title and objective
- Task 1: **Why?**
    * Define the aim or question of your project
    
- Task 2: **What?** Describe data set
    * Provide a link to the data and describe the metadata (author, date, extent, resolution, etc.)
    * Can it be accessed via a script, and how (i.e. API or download link)?
    * Estimate how large the data set will be for your project
        - e.g. do this by a little test download of one file unless you decide to work in https://code.earthengine.google.com/
        - **Important here is to keep the data set small!**
        
* Task 3: **How?**: Methods and potential results
    * Which functionality or approach will you use to achieve this?
    * What will be the result, output, and/or visualization?

## Submission Deadlines

* Inform us about team changes ASAP
* Submit your proposal **before next Friday 15:00** (ideally before the exam)
* Review the other teams **after the exam** (before **18:00**), via Codegrade
* If you get a NO GO, make changes ASAP 
* **on Monday (January 25) morning - all proposals must be approved then**
* On Monday morning you will know which group you are working together with and will get your Project starter repository
