## Today in the morning

* Finalise the excercise from the previous day.
* Check the question and answers forum
* Think about a simple, concise, scripting challenge 
    - See the next slide for a description

## The geo-challenge

* Objective
    * Demonstrate scripting skills in a spatial oriented challenge
    * Develop a reproducible RStudio project that does something geo-cool!
    * Demonstrating capacity to read, visualize, and write spatial data that other can use
    * Using basic scripting concepts for handling spatial data
    * Using different functions and libraries (new?)
    * Writing a clear, structured and well documented project that is understandable by others

## The geo-challenge

* Planning
    * 4 full days for project work
    * Friday 15/01 afternoon
    * Monday - Thursday (25-28/01)
  
* Deadline
    * Projects to be handed in by Thursday 28/01 (14u)
    * Presentation Friday morning.

## The geo-challenge

* Deliverables:
    * A project that is reproducible and produces a result (map, analysis) for your presentation
    * Submit the project via a Git Repository
    * A presentation where you explain
        * objective
        * method i.e. workflow
        * result by some nice visualisation (map, output, analysis)

## Example geo-challenges

* First identify a data set that you can use (e.g. data available for download, etc.). You need to have a rather simple, not too large data set that you can `analyse`.
* A simple challenge or question is good as long as you apply and demonstrated geo-scripting skills
* Examples:  
    - [Pieter Bouke (Geo-scripting 2013)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxl0UxklsP1EVHRTeHd6S2dBdmM/view?usp=sharing)
    - See Lesson 2 for examples of little demo projects
    - Develop a new excercise for one of the lessons e.g. vector/raster analysis
    - Develop an R or Python script that can analyse MODIS data available from the FluxNet site, and apply BFAST on it ([See the tutorial](https://github.com/verbe039/BFASTforAEO/blob/master/BFASTExcercise.pdf?raw=true))

## The geo-challenge

* Teams?!
    - You can work on your own or teams of two or three
    - [Fill in the sheet and also add your objective one sentence](http://goo.gl/forms/WUyKwTFoL8) (and later on your GitHub Repository)

## Assignment

* Write a project proposal of half a page that contains:
    * team name and members
    * geo-challenge title and objective
    * What? short description of what you want to do
    * How? Descripe methodology
    * What will be the result, output, and/or visualisation

* Submit by blackboard before tomorrow 1030u.
