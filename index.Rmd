## Today in the morning

* Finalize the DataCamp assignment
* Think about a feasible, concise, scripting challenge (see next slides)
* Check the [*Question and Answers*](http://www.geo-informatie.nl/courses/grs33806/question2answer/) forum and try to answer one question


## The geo-challenge

* Objective
    * Demonstrate scripting skills in a spatial oriented challenge
    * Demonstrate capacity to read, visualize, and write spatial data that other can use
    * Use different functions and libraries (e.g. try out new libraries)
    * Write a clear, structured and well documented project that is understandable by others

## The geo-challenge

* Planning
    * 4 days for project work
  
* Deadline
    * GitLab link deadline by Thursday 31/01/2019 (14u)
    * After that one other team needs to review the project of the other team
    * Submit presentation (pdf) to Blackboard - Script Review Center - before 9 am on Friday morning 1/02/2019

* Friday final week 
    * Presentation (5 minute presentation + 3 minutes feedback by the other team using the rubric
    and questions from the group)
    * Evaluation by expert jury panel

## The geo-challenge

* Deliverables:
    * A project that is reproducible and produces a result (map, analysis) for your presentation
    * Submit the project via a GitLab Repository
    * A presentation where you explain
        * objective
        * workflow
        * results by some clear visualization (map, output, analysis)
        * what have you learned? 

## Example geo-challenges

- First identify a data set that you can use (e.g. data available for download, etc.). You need to have a small (!) data set that you can `analyse`.
- A simple challenge or question is good as long as you apply and demonstrated geo-scripting skills
- Examples:
    - [We have some topics available](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/ProjectIntro/topics.html)
- **Two projects of last year will be presented during the lecture today by the student assistents**

## The geo-challenge

* Teams?!
    - You can work on your own or teams of two

## Assignment for today

- Write a concise project proposal of *maximum one page* that contains (**bullet points are OK!**):
    - Team name and members
    - Geo-challenge title and objective
    - Task 1: **What?** short description of what you want to do
        * Define the aim of your project, for example by formulating a research question.
    - Task 2: **How?** Describe methodology and data set
        * Provide a link to the data and describe the metadata (author, date, extent, resolution, etc.)
        * Can it be accessed via a script, and how (i.e. API or download link)?
        * Estimate how large the data set will be for your project
            - e.g. do this by a little test download of one file unless you decide to work in https://earthengine.google.com/
            - **Important here is to keep the data set small!**
    * Task 3: Result and discussion
        * What will be the result, output, and/or visualization?
        * Which R/Python packages will you use to achieve this?
        * What challenges or issues do you foresee? 
        
## Submission 

* Submit your project proposal to GitLab before 1630u today so the the other team can review.
* Submit as a short readable structured text file (i.e. .txt or .md format)
    * make sure that it is easily readable
