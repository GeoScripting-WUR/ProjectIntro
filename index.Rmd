## Today in the morning

* Think about a feasible, concise, scripting challenge  (see next slides)
* Check the question and answers forum

## overall tips and tricks

- R-SIG-GEO? Who knows what this is?

## The geo-challenge

* Objective
    * Demonstrate scripting skills in a spatial oriented challenge
    * Develop a reproducible RStudio project that does something geo-cool!
    * Demonstrating capacity to read, visualize, and write spatial data that other can use
    * Using basic scripting concepts for handling spatial data
    * Using different functions and libraries (e.g. try out new libraries)
    * Writing a clear, structured and well documented project that is understandable by others

## The geo-challenge

* Planning
    * 4 full days for project work
    * Monday - Thursday
  
* Deadline
    * Github link deadline by Thursday (14u)
    * After that one other team needs to review the project of the other team
    * Submit presentation to Blackboard - Script Review Center - before the end of the day

* Friday final week 
    * Presentation (5 minute presentation + 5 feedback of the other team and questions from the group)
    * Evaluation by a expert jury panel

## The geo-challenge

* Deliverables:
    * A project that is reproducible and produces a result (map, analysis) for your presentation
    * Submit the project via a Git Repository
    * A presentation where you explain
        * objective
        * method i.e. workflow
        * result by some nice visualisation (map, output, analysis)
        * what have you learned? 

## Example geo-challenges

* First identify a data set that you can use (e.g. data available for download, etc.). You need to have a small (!) dataset that you can `analyse`.
* A simple challenge or question is good as long as you apply and demonstrated geo-scripting skills
* Examples:
    - [We have some topics available](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/ProjectIntro/topics.html)

## The geo-challenge

* Teams?!
    - You can work on your own or teams of two

## Assignment for today

* Write a project proposal of half a page that contains:
    * team name and members
    * geo-challenge title and objective
    * What? short description of what you want to do
    * How? Descripe methodology
    * What will be the result, output, and/or visualisation
